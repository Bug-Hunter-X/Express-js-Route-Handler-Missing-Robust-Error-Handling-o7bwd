# Express.js Route Handler Missing Robust Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: inadequate error handling for invalid input or unexpected situations.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code.  The solution, `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates improved error handling and more informative error responses.

## Bug Description

The provided route handler lacks robust error handling. When an invalid user ID is provided, the application might crash or return a generic error message, hindering proper debugging and user experience.

## Solution

The solution enhances the error handling to address potential issues, including:

* **Type validation**: Checking if `userId` is a valid number before parsing.
* **User not found**: Returning a 404 Not Found response with a more descriptive message.
* **Generic error handling**: Implementing a catch-all error handler to prevent crashes due to unhandled exceptions.

This improved error handling makes the application more robust and reliable.
